# SFML - Super Mario Project

This is a small and simple project to learn and unterstand SFML and the logics and principles behind game development.

## What is this project about?

You will be able to run a application, which represents an example level of Super Mario World, where you can control Mario to do a jump or moving him to left and right.

## What is SFML? 

> Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide a simple application programming interface (API) to various multimedia components in computers. It is written in C++ with bindings available for C, Crystal, D, Euphoria, Go, Java, Julia, .NET, Nim, OCaml, Python, Ruby, and Rust.[3] Experimental mobile ports were made available for Android and iOS with the release of SFML 2.2.[4]

> SFML handles creating and input to windows, and creating and managing OpenGL contexts. It also provides a graphics module for simple hardware acceleration of 2D computer graphics which includes text rendering using FreeType, an audio module that uses OpenAL and a networking module for basic Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) communication.

> SFML is free and open-source software provided under the terms of the zlib/png license. It is available on Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD. The first version v1.0 was released on 9 August 2007, the latest version v2.5.0 was released on 9 May 2018.
